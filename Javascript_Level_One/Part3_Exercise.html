    <h1> Welcome to your First Excercise!</h1>
    <p> For this exercise we will be creating a weight metric converter</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> We will take in a number in pounds (lbs) and convert it to kilograms (kg). Right now we only
      know enought to do this one way, but later on we will learn how to add logic to this sort of
    problem!</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>To complete this exercise do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Link this HTML file (Part3_Exercise.html) to you own.js file</li>
      <li> Use Javascript to accept a number input in pounds (lbs)</li>
      <li> The in your js file convert this number to kilograms (*0.454)</li>
      <li> Afterwards report back in an alert what the weightr is in kg</li>
      <li> Then log/write "Conversion Completed" to the console</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
